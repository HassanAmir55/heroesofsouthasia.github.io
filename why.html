    <h2>OUR RATIONALE AND EXPERIENCES</h2>
    <p>
      As South Asian students who immigrated to Canada within the last decade and currently study at post secondary/secondary school institutions, we have witnessed firsthand how <span class="highlight">anti-immigrant politics</span> and misinformation have fueled <span class="highlight">racism</span> against our community. South Asians, who comprise a significant portion of recent immigrants, have been unfairly scapegoated for complex societal issues such as the <span class="highlight">housing crisis</span>. Despite evidence showing that housing shortages and speculation are the root causes, many individuals blame immigrants—especially South Asians—for rising rents and property prices, which has sharply increased <span class="highlight">racial hostility</span> and discrimination in many Canadian cities<sup>1</sup>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This rise in racial hostility is supported by alarming data. Statistics Canada reported a <span class="highlight">70% increase</span><sup>2</sup> in hate crimes targeting Asian Canadians between 2019 and 2022, with South Asians disproportionately affected. The <span class="highlight">Canadian Race Relations Foundation</span> found that nearly <span class="highlight">45%</span><sup>3</sup> of South Asian Canadians experienced racial discrimination recently, with many reporting that social media platforms have played a significant role in spreading xenophobic misinformation and stereotypes, amplifying anti-South Asian sentiment<sup>4</sup>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Systemic barriers worsen these experiences. South Asian immigrants face higher rates of <span class="highlight">unemployment and underemployment</span>, often due to racial bias and the non-recognition of foreign credentials. Housing studies indicate that South Asian families are more likely to live in <span class="highlight">overcrowded</span> conditions and face significant challenges in accessing affordable housing. These economic vulnerabilities contribute to social exclusion and reinforce discriminatory narratives blaming immigrants for economic hardship<sup>5</sup>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The mental health toll of these realities is profound. Recent research shows that over half of South Asian Canadians report <span class="highlight">increased anxiety and depression</span> linked to discrimination, economic stress, and social isolation. Hostile rhetoric, both online and offline, further exacerbates these impacts, highlighting the urgent need for <span class="highlight">culturally sensitive mental health supports</span> and inclusive policies to address both racism and economic inequities<sup>6</sup>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In response to these challenges, we created this initiative as a digital sanctuary for South Asians across Canada. It is a place to amplify <span class="highlight">diverse voices</span>, counter harmful narratives, and provide access to resources that empower communities to challenge racism and build solidarity. By fostering education, advocacy, and allyship, we strive to build a Canada where <span class="highlight">equity and belonging</span> are restored back into Canadian Society.
