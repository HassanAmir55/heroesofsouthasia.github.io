  <h2>RISING TRENDS IN SOUTH ASIAN RACISM</h2>

  <!-- 1. Rise in Hate Crimes & Misinformation -->
  <p>
    <strong><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle" style="color:#e0b07d; margin-right: 8px;"></i> Hate Crimes & Public Misinformation:</strong> 
    Since the onset of COVID-19, there has been a sharp <span class="highlight">increase in racially motivated hate crimes</span> targeting South Asians. From verbal harassment to violent attacks, South Asian Canadians—particularly Sikhs and Muslims—have been wrongfully blamed for spreading the virus or disrupting “Canadian values.” This has been further fueled by biased reporting and political misdirection.
  </p>

  <!-- 2. Political & Media Scapegoating -->
  <p>
    <strong><i class="fas fa-bullhorn" style="color:#e0b07d; margin-right: 8px;"></i> Political & Media Scapegoating:</strong> 
    In recent years, <span class="highlight">South Asian immigrants have been scapegoated</span> in national debates around housing, healthcare, and public infrastructure. Politicians and commentators have pointed fingers at international students and newcomers—many of South Asian descent—as the root of complex systemic issues, fueling resentment and division.
  </p>

  <!-- 3. The Role of Social Media -->
  <p>
    <strong><i class="fas fa-hashtag" style="color:#e0b07d; margin-right: 8px;"></i> The Role of Social Media:</strong> 
    Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok have become hubs for <span class="highlight">xenophobic narratives and viral misinformation</span>. South Asian communities are often misrepresented in viral clips, targeted by hate accounts, or excluded from important cultural and political discourse. Algorithms have unintentionally promoted biased content, worsening the cycle of online radicalization and offline discrimination.
  </p>

  <p>
    By organizing these trends into clear categories, we reveal how racism has adapted to modern times. It may look different today—but it’s just as real, and just as dangerous. Raising awareness is the first step to dismantling it.
